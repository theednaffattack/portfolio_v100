## INGREDIENTS

-   2 Yukon Gold or Red Potatoes
-   ½ cup Yellow Onion
-   ½ cup Bell Pepper
-   ½ cup Crumbled Breakfast Sausage
-   2 Large Eggs
-   ⅛ tsp Ground Thyme
-   ¼ tsp Red Pepper Flakes
-   Salt to Taste
-   Black Pepper
-   olive oil

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Pre-heat a skillet or cast iron skillet to medium.
   While the skillet is pre-heating. Cube the potatoes and microwave in a covered bowl for 2 minutes to speed the cooking process.
2. Add a tablespoon of olive oil to the skillet and add the cooked potatoes, onions and bell pepper. Stir frequently for 4-5 minutes, until vegetables are soft.
   Add the thyme and red pepper flakes to taste and stir to combine.
3. Add the breakfast sausage and cook until no longer pink. Make sure the sausage is fully combined with the potato mixture.
4. Carve out 2 holes, grease with extra olive oil and crack the eggs directly onto the hot skillet. The eggs will take about 5-7 minutes to fully set. If you prefer you can place the pan in a 350 degree oven for 5 additional minutes to help set the tops of the eggs.
5. Once the eggs have set, divide the mixture onto 2 places and enjoy immediately.
6. Add additional salt and pepper, to taste.
