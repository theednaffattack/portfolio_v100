## Info

**prep time:** 5 MINS<br>
**cook time:** 30 MINS<br>
**total time:** 35 MINS<br>
**yield:** 2 CUPS

## Ingredients

- 1 large red onion, peeled and very thinly sliced\*
- 3/4 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1/4 cup water
- 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1â€“2 tablespoons sweetener (such as maple syrup, honey, sugar, etc.)

## Directions

1. Heat the vinegar mixture. In a small saucepan, stir together the vinegar, water, salt and your desired amount of sweetener. Cook over medium-high heat until the mixture reaches a simmer. (Or alternately, you can heat the mixture in the microwave.)
2. Combine in a jar. Place the thinly-sliced onions in a mason jar. Pour the hot vinegar mixture over the onions, screw on the lid, and shake the onions briefly until they are evenly coated with the vinegar mixture.
3. Marinate. Let the onions marinate for 30 minutes. (You may need to press the onions down with a spoon so that they are all submerged under the vinegar mixture.)
4. Serve. Serve immediately, or refrigerate the onions in a sealed container for up to 2 weeks.
