## Ingredients

-   1 onion
-   150 g / 5 oz smoked bacon
-   600 g / 21 oz boiled potatoes best boiled the day before - sliced about 0.5 cm
-   3 tablespoon vegetable oil with 2 tbsp butter
-   salt
-   pepper
-   handful parsley â€“ finely chopped.

## Directions

1. Cube the onion and the bacon.
2. Heat 1 teaspoon butter in the frying pan and first start frying the bacon, then add the onion and fry until the onion is translucent. (Make sure that the onion does not burn, as this will leave a bitter taste).
3. Remove both from the pan and set aside.
4. Peel the potatoes (optional) and slice into 0.5 cm thick slices. Melt the remaining tablespoon butter in the pan and fry the potatoes on medium heat until crispy. When adding the potatoes to the frying pan, make sure that each potato has space in the pan. This will ensure that they fry evenly. If your pan is too small to fry all potatoes at once, then fry in batches.
5. Do not stir the potatoes but carefully turn them individually.
6. After approximately 20 minutes add the onions and bacon and fry for a further 2 minutes while carefully turning with a spatula.
7. Season with salt and pepper. Before serving, mix in the chopped parsley.
