## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 cup thinly sliced mushrooms
- 1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
- ½ cup diced onion
- 1 pound ground beef
- freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- 2 cloves minced garlic
- 1 ⅓ tablespoons flour
- 2 tablespoons vodka (Optional)
- 2 ½ cups beef broth, or as needed
- 1 cup water
- 2 ½ cups egg noodles
- ½ cup sour cream, plus more for serving
- 2 tablespoons fresh sliced chives or green onions

## Directions

1. Melt butter and oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, season with salt, and saute, stirring occasionally, until they turn golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Add onion and ground beef. Cook, stirring, until meat is browned and crumbly, and onions turn soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with black pepper and cayenne.
2. Stir in minced garlic and flour, and cook for 1 minute. Pour in vodka and allow to evaporate, about 30 seconds. Stir in beef broth and water and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.
3. Reduce heat to medium, and mix in noodles. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 5 minutes. Uncover and stir thoroughly. Cover again and cook until noodles are just tender, about 3 minutes. (See Cook's Note.)
4. Once noodles are cooked, reduce heat to low, and stir in sour cream. Serve immediately with additional sour cream and green onions or chives if so desired.
